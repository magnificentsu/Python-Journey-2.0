My name is Magnificent Su.

I'm creating this file as part of an exercise to test my Python knowledge.

If this exercise goes well, I'm definitely going to feel more confident about my Python knowledge.

There are probably more things that I can say in this text file, but I'll leave it there.

One more thing though, I'm just adding sentences at this point to make the text file longer.

I'm actually running out of things to say.

If you can think of something to say let me know.

Wait, who's going to let me know?

I'm literally talking to myself, so I guess I'm the one that has to let myself know.

Knowing me though, I usually always have more to say.

I just know that you don't have to say everything you think

Ok, I'm really done now.
